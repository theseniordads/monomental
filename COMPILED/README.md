# Compiled versions of "Mono Mental"

Here you'll find compiled versions of the demo, ready to run on your Atari ST or emulator.

The demo requires and Atari STFM or later with TOS 1.04 minumum, and **hi-res mono monitor**. (Or an emulator like Hatari configured as above.) Note that despite what the demo says, it can run on a 512K machine. The demo can be run from a floppy disk or a hard drive.

## Versions

### `ORIGINAL` 
The original 11th April 1998 version of the demo, released at [the very first ALT party](https://www.altparty.org/2008/the-first-alternative-party.html) in Turku, Finland. 

### `REMASTER`
The compiled version of the demo from the reverse-engineered source code. This version is designed to be as close to the original version as possible. (Although it's not 100% identical.) For more details on the reverse-engineering process, see [here](https://github.com/theseniordads/monomental/blob/main/DOCS/README.md).

### `REMIX` aka "The Director's Cut"
A tweaked version of the "remastered" version. The contains the following differences to the original and "remastered" versions:
* The timing of the demo, which slowly drifted out of sync in the original version, has been fixed.
* Smaller memory footprint.
* The message displayed to users when run on a colour display no longer crashes the machine upon exit.
